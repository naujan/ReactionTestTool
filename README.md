# ReactionTimeTool
Script for automating [human benchmark reaction time test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime) 
Made for fun, educational purposes. Made on/for Windows.
## 📌 Note
- This script reads the current pointer location and detects the color behind it. It uses a fixed `targetColor`, meaning it will only work reliably on Human Benchmark (or anywhere with the same RGB value).
- This is one of my first projects and is not fully optimized. Feedback about performance or improvements is welcome!
## ⚙️ Setup
#### Through  run.bat
Download the `ReactionTimeTool.JAR` and `run.bat` from releases, put it in the same directory and click on the batch script. It should run perfectly.

#### Through command
Download the `ReactionTimeTool.JAR` and run:
```bash
java -jar "Path\To\ReactionTestTool.jar"
```
